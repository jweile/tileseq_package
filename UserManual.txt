The TileSEQ_AnalysisPackage1.5 contains: 
three perl scripts: TileSEQ_FASTQ2Function.pl  tileseq_mut2func.pl  tileseq_sam2mut.pl
two example input files: CBS_seq.txt  mut2func_info.csv

Perl and Bowtie2 are required to be installed. 
The scripts were written to process fastq.gz files (e.x., 1_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz/1_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz) generated by TileSEQ by submitting jobs to Sun Grid Engine (SGE) queuing system. 

Procedure:
1. Copy the three perl scripts into the directory where the fastq.gz files are.
2. Create two input files for your own gene and experiments: 
geneName_seq.txt contains template sequence for alignment and coding sequence including stop codon, the file name needs to be exactly "geneName_seq.txt" (geneName in captial letter), the file is required to have a specific format containing two lines: the first line is 'geneName_template' followed by a space or tab and then the actual template sequence including the coding sequence and upstream/downstream sequences, the second line is 'geneName_coding' followed by a space or tab and then the actual coding sequence.
mut2func_info.csv file contains seven lines. The first line contains the corresponding amino acid positions for each tile. The rest six lines contains the sequencing sample name for each multiplexed librarys sorted into each of the six experiments: nonselect1, nonselect2, select1, select2, wt1, wt2.Note: for quality check, the mut2func_info.csv should only contain three lines including the first line with tile information, and two lines with sequencing sample name for nonselect1 and nonselect2 (in QC, nonselect1 and nonselect2 are the same)
3. Run the control perl script TileSEQ_FASTQ2Function.pl after reading the doumentation in the beginning of the script. Three arugents are required for this script.
4. Six new directories will be created:
bowtieIndex: Bowtie2 index files for your gene
shfile: all the .sh files for the job submission
fastqfile: all the unzipped fastq files
samfile: all the alignment files in sam format
mutationCallfile: six files wil begenerated for each library (e.x., 1report.txt, 1AAchange.txt, 1MultipleMut.txt, 1deletion.txt, 1insertion.txt, 1noncoding.txt
resultfile: five result files will be generated (correlation_control.txt, correlation_nonselect.txt, correlation_select.txt, foldchange.txt, rawData.txt)
